To Replicate, download or clone the Git repo.

Each Level of the game is uploaded seperately for ease of access.
Download the said folder, or level, and unzip the file. Opening the folder with Unity will now allow all work to be opened and seen within the Unity program.

Example:
1. Clone or Download Repo
2. Open "Level3.7z" by extracting since file is in Zip
3. Once folder is extracted, Open with Unity.

Repeat for any of the three folders.
